<h1><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Welcome to "Hunt the Wumpus"!</h1>
<pre> The Wumpus lives in a cave of rooms.</pre>
<pre> Each room has 3 tunnels leading to other rooms.</pre>
<h2><br /> <strong>Hazards:</strong></h2>
<pre><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> Bottomless pits</strong></span> - two rooms have bottomless pits in them.</pre>
<pre> If you go there, you fall into the pit(and lose!)</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> Super bats</strong></span> - two other rooms have super bats.</pre>
<pre> If you go there, a bat grabs you and takes you to some other room at random.</pre>
<pre> (Which may be troublesome)</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<h2><strong> Wumpus:</strong></h2>
<pre> The Wumpus is not bothered by hazards. Usually he is asleep</pre>
<pre> Two things wake him up: you shooting an arrow or you entering his room</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre> If the wumpus wakes up he moves (p = .75) one room or stays still (p = .25)</pre>
<pre> If he enters youre room he eats you and you lose!</pre>
<h2><br /><strong>Controls:</strong></h2>
<pre> Each turn you may move or shoot a crooked arrow</pre>
<pre><strong> Moving:</strong> You can move from one room to annother by using drag and drop.</pre>
<pre><strong> Arrows:</strong> You have 5 arrows. You lose when you run out. Each arrow<br /> <br /> can go from 1 to 3 rooms. You aim by marking the rooms to shoot thru with the <br /> <br /> right mouse button hold down.<br /> <br /> If the arrow hits the wumpus, you win. <br /><br /> <strong>Marking Hazards:</strong> You can mark each room with the hazards you expect using <br /> <br /> right click on it.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre> When you are one room away from the wumpus or hazard, the computer says:</pre>
<pre><strong> Wumpus:</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I smell the wumpus"</span></pre>
<pre><strong> Bat:</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I hear a bat"</span></pre>
<pre> P<strong>it:</strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I feel a breeze"</span></pre>
